This rule automates the guide creation workflow:

When I ask to create a new guide:

- first let's brainstorm possible guides ideas. I would like you to give me 5 possible ideas
- when I pick an idea you can ask some followup questions 
- then let's create a plan for the guide 
- when everything is ok write the whole guide content
