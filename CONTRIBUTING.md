### 🧱 Rules
- **Use kebab-case** for folders/files.
- **Each `.mdx` file must include frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
title: Short and clear
description: One-sentence summary
tags: [ai, cursor]
---
```

- **Use Markdown + MDX.** Include language tags on code blocks.
- **Images** go in `assets/` and use relative paths.

### 🧠 Writing Style
- Write like you talk — no academic tone.
- Show first, explain after.
- One topic = one file.
- Keep chapters short.
- Examples > theory.
