# Capture Testimonial Videos with Vidlo

Vidlo makes it effortless to collect authentic, on‑brand testimonial videos and optional lead info from customers, fans, or community members — without asking them to download an app. Share a link or QR code, and submissions flow straight into your dashboard where they’re automatically branded and ready to publish. Learn more at [Vidlo](https://vidlo.video).

## What you’ll need

- A Vidlo workspace with access to create campaigns
- Your brand assets (logo, optional overlay)
- A place to share: email, social, website, in‑store signage, event booths

---

## Quick start (5–10 minutes)

1. Create a new campaign
   - Give it a clear name and short purpose statement.
   - Add a simple recording prompt (e.g., “Tell us in 20–30 seconds how [product] helped you”).
   - Upload your logo and, if desired, select a branded overlay or effects so every video is on‑brand.

2. Choose how people record
   - Share a campaign link or display a QR code — no app downloads required.
   - Great for events, email follow‑ups, post‑purchase flows, or support wins.

3. Collect submissions automatically
   - Videos are recorded from any phone/tablet/computer and appear in your Vidlo dashboard.
   - Optional lead capture can be enabled so each video can include contact info.

4. Review and brand
   - Approve the best takes. Vidlo automatically applies your logo/overlay to keep output consistent.
   - Organize by tags or campaigns for quicker reuse.

5. Publish and use everywhere
   - Embed on landing pages, product pages, or help docs.
   - Share to social, drop into email campaigns, or export for ads.

## Sharing and embeds

- From your Vidlo dashboard, grab the share or embed options for any approved video.
- Paste the embed into your CMS or site builder. Most platforms (Shopify, Webflow, WordPress, etc.) accept the embed snippet.
- For in‑person capture, print the campaign QR code and place it at check‑in, at merch tables, near registers, or on table tents.

Tip: Pair embeds with short written context above or below the video so visitors know what to watch for and what action to take.

## Best practices for higher‑converting testimonials

- Be specific with prompts: ask for the problem, the moment of value, and the outcome.
- Keep it short: aim for 20–45 seconds. Short prompts produce punchier videos.
- Time it right: ask right after a win (support solved, event excitement, delivery day).
- Make it easy: link + QR everywhere your customers already are.
- Incentivize: offer a small perk or entry into a giveaway to increase participation.
- Standardize framing: show a quick example so creators match tone and length.
- Add lead capture when relevant so great videos also fuel your CRM.

---

## Running multiple campaigns

- Create separate campaigns for launches, events, regions, or audience segments.
- Use distinct prompts and overlays per campaign to keep outputs on‑brand.
- Reuse winning prompts; retire prompts that underperform.
